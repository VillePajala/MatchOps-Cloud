## Test Coverage Improvement Plan (Release-Grade)

### Executive summary
- **Current**: ~36–40% lines/statements; permissive CI gates; solid unit breadth; light integration/E2E; masking flags in Jest.
- **Target (release-grade)**:
  - **Global**: 80% statements/lines/functions, 70% branches
  - **Per-scope minimums**:
    - `src/utils/`: 95% lines/statements/functions, 85% branches
    - `src/stores/`: 90% lines/functions, 80% branches
    - `src/hooks/`: 85% lines/functions, 75% branches
    - Core components (`HomePage`, `SoccerField`, `TimerOverlay`, `ControlBar`, `GameInfoBar`): 80% lines/functions, 70% branches per file
    - `src/app/**`: 75% lines/functions, 65% branches
  - **Quality gates**: 0 a11y violations, 100% pass for critical E2E journeys, no open-handle leaks, flake rate <2% on CI

### Why this matters
- Increases confidence to ship and iterate quickly
- Prevents regressions in core match workflows and data integrity
- Aligns with production readiness plan and GTM timelines

### Threshold configuration (final target)

// jest.config.js
coverageThreshold: {
  global: { statements: 80, lines: 80, functions: 80, branches: 70 },

}
```

### 5-week execution plan (UPDATED: Extended plan with Week 5 completion)

#### Week 1 — Foundations and quick wins (goal: ~55–60% global) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Harden config** ✅
  - Align docs and `jest.config.js` thresholds; enable `coverageReporters: ['text-summary','html','lcov']`; publish HTML and lcov (Codecov).
  - Remove `forceExit`; set `detectOpenHandles: true`; fix any leaks exposed.
  - Remove `--passWithNoTests` from CI command; keep `--maxWorkers=2` for stability.
- **Threshold ramp (step 1)** ✅
  - Global: 55/55/55/45 (statements/lines/functions/branches)
  - Scope gates: `utils 85/85/85/75`, `stores 80/80/80/70`, `hooks 70/70/70/60`, core components 50/50/50/45, `src/app/**` 50/50/50/45
- **Coverage quick wins** ✅
  - Top up `utils`, `stores`, `hooks` edge/error/branch paths to meet scope gates.
  - Add deterministic clock helpers for timer tests; migrate timer specs to fake timers.
- **Integration setup** ✅
  - Add MSW; establish handlers for auth, save/load, sync, and failure scenarios.
  - Write 5–8 integration specs: email confirm/reset, save queue retry/backoff, load existing game, error banners.

#### Week 2 — Core UI and App Router (goal: ~65–70% global) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Core components** ✅
  - `HomePage`: smoke render + key actions (start game, save, error handling).
  - `ControlBar`: pause/resume/reset branches; disabled states.
  - `TimerOverlay`: start/pause/resume; persistence across reload with fake timers.
  - `GameInfoBar`: score updates; team switch; edge inputs.
- **App Router pages** ✅
  - `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/layout.tsx`: provider wiring, redirects/guards.
- **Threshold ramp (step 2)** ✅
  - Global: 65/65/65/55; core component/file gates → 65/65/65/55; `src/app/**` → 60/60/60/50

#### Week 3 — Reliability integrations and E2E (goal: ~72–78% global) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Integration depth** ✅
  - Storage sync: offline queue, retry/backoff, conflict resolution.
  - IndexedDB fallback and error recovery; autosave events (success/failure).
  - Import/export roundtrip validity.
- **Playwright E2E (CI)** ✅
  - Journeys: first-time onboarding; full match (setup→play→save); offline→online resume; export file presence.
  - Retries 2 on CI; collect traces on retry; deflake root causes.
- **Threshold ramp (step 3)** ✅
  - Global: 75/75/75/65; `utils 90/90/90/80`, `stores 85/85/85/75`, `hooks 80/80/80/70`, core files 75/75/75/65

#### Week 4 — Close the gap (hit 80/80/80/70) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Branch gap sweep** ✅
  - Cover timeouts, quota exceeded, malformed data recovery, multi-tab concurrency.
- **Accessibility gate** ✅
  - Ensure `jest-axe` runs across modals/pages; fail CI on violations.
- **Threshold ramp (final)** ✅
  - Global: 80/80/80/70; enforce per-scope/file gates above.

#### Week 5 — Advanced testing and comprehensive coverage (goal: 85%+ global) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Hook testing excellence** ✅
  - Added comprehensive tests for `useDebouncedSave` hook (24 test cases): debouncing, race conditions, retry logic with exponential backoff, timeout management, stale closure prevention
  - Added comprehensive tests for `useDeviceIntegration` hook (40 test cases): device APIs, sharing, clipboard, vibration, fullscreen, wake lock, geolocation, camera capture, error management
  - Enhanced existing hook test coverage with edge cases and browser compatibility scenarios

  - Added comprehensive tests for `playerStats` utility (22 test cases): calculation algorithms, performance metrics, data transformation, edge cases
  - Enhanced `typeGuards` with 30 additional edge cases: boundary conditions, malformed data, performance testing, circular references
- **Infrastructure improvements** ✅
  - Enhanced IndexedDB fallback tests for cross-browser compatibility
  - Fixed MSW mock imports for better Jest compatibility  
  - Improved mock server setup and error handling
  - Better test isolation and dependency management

  - 6–8 integration tests (auth, load/save, offline queue, import/export)
  - 3–4 Playwright journeys (onboarding, full match, offline resume, export)
- **CI gates**
  - Remove masking flags; enforce coverage thresholds and a11y; block merges on failures

### Risks and mitigations
- **Large complex components (e.g., `HomePage`, canvas)**: Focus on public behaviors, controlled props, fake timers; avoid implementation-detail assertions.
- **Flakiness**: Use retries only temporarily; prioritize root-cause fixes; add deterministic helpers.
- **Time constraints**: Parallelize writing tests by scope; start with deterministic layers (utils/stores) for quick coverage gains.

### Ownership and cadence
- DRI: Testing lead (assign named owner)
- Weekly retro: review coverage report, top failing specs, flake log; adjust backlog and thresholds as scheduled

### Source of truth for metrics
- Include coverage summary footer in PR descriptions (lines/statements/functions/branches) with commit hash and timestamp
- Store latest HTML report artifact per PR; keep Codecov badge updated in `README.md`
