## üîß Pre-Testing Setup

### Step 1: Deploy SQL Functions to Supabase

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire content of:
-- docs/production/SQL/account_deletion.sql
```

**Verification**:
```sql
-- Check functions were created successfully
SELECT routine_name, routine_type 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
AND routine_name LIKE '%account%' 
OR routine_name LIKE '%delete_user_data%';

-- Should return:
-- delete_user_data | FUNCTION
-- process_expired_account_deletions | FUNCTION  
-- verify_user_data_deleted | FUNCTION
```

### Step 2: Deploy Edge Functions to Supabase

```bash
# Deploy the account deletion processor
supabase functions deploy process-account-deletion

# Deploy the scheduled cleanup (optional for initial testing)
supabase functions deploy scheduled-account-cleanup
```

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in your Supabase project:
```
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
SCHEDULED_FUNCTION_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-for-cron-jobs
```

## üß™ Testing Protocol

### Test 1: Request Account Deletion

**Prerequisites**: 
- Test user account with some data (players, games, etc.)
- User logged in to the application

**Steps**:
1. Open Account Deletion Modal
2. Check "I understand this cannot be undone"
3. Enter password
4. Click "Request Deletion"

**Expected Results**:
```
‚úÖ Success message appears
‚úÖ Shows grace period expiry date (30 days from now)
‚úÖ Shows days remaining counter
‚úÖ Modal updates to show cancellation option
‚úÖ Database record created in account_deletion_requests table
```

**Verification Query**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM account_deletion_requests WHERE user_id = 'test-user-id';
-- Should show: status='pending', scheduled_deletion_at = NOW() + 30 days
```

### Test 2: Cancel Account Deletion

**Prerequisites**: Account deletion request exists

**Steps**:
1. Open Account Deletion Modal (should show pending state)
2. Click "Cancel Deletion Request"

**Expected Results**:
```
‚úÖ Success message appears  
‚úÖ Modal returns to initial state
‚úÖ Database record updated to 'cancelled'
```

**Verification Query**:
```sql
SELECT status FROM account_deletion_requests WHERE user_id = 'test-user-id';
-- Should show: status='cancelled'
```

### Test 3: Complete Data Deletion (Manual Test)

**Prerequisites**: 
- Account deletion request with past grace period date
- Test data in multiple tables

**Setup Test Data**:
```sql
-- Create test data
INSERT INTO account_deletion_requests (user_id, scheduled_deletion_at, status)
VALUES ('test-user-id', NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day', 'pending');
```

**Steps**:
1. Open Account Deletion Modal
2. Should show "Grace period has expired" message
3. Click "Finalize Deletion"
4. Wait for completion

**Expected Results**:
```
‚úÖ Success message with logout countdown
‚úÖ User automatically logged out
‚úÖ All user data completely removed
```

**Verification Queries**:
```sql
-- Check all tables are empty for this user
SELECT * FROM verify_user_data_deleted('test-user-id');
-- Should return 0 for all tables

-- Check specific tables manually
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM players WHERE user_id = 'test-user-id'; -- Should be 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games WHERE user_id = 'test-user-id'; -- Should be 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM seasons WHERE user_id = 'test-user-id'; -- Should be 0
-- etc. for all user tables
```

### Test 4: Edge Function Direct Test

**Prerequisites**: Valid user access token

**Test via curl**:
```bash
# Get access token from browser dev tools or Supabase auth
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/process-account-deletion \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "test-user-id"}'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Account and all associated data has been permanently deleted",
  "deletedTables": [
    "timer_states: 2 rows",
    "games: 5 rows", 
    "players: 10 rows",
    "seasons: 1 rows"
  ],
  "processed_at": "2025-08-11T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Test 5: Scheduled Cleanup Test (Optional)

**Prerequisites**: 
- Multiple accounts with expired grace periods
- Scheduled function secret key configured

**Manual Trigger**:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/scheduled-account-cleanup \
  -H "x-scheduled-function-key: YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Processed 2 expired account deletions",
  "processed_users": [
    {
      "user_id": "user-1-id",
      "summary": "games: 3 rows, players: 5 rows, seasons: 1 rows"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üö® Critical Verification Checklist

Before considering this feature complete, verify:

### Data Integrity
- [ ] All user tables are completely empty after deletion
- [ ] No orphaned records remain in any table
- [ ] Foreign key relationships maintained during deletion
- [ ] No errors during referential integrity checks

### Security 
- [ ] Users can only delete their own accounts
- [ ] Edge function requires valid authentication
- [ ] No direct client-side deletion possible
- [ ] Service role key properly secured

### UI/UX
- [ ] Clear messaging about grace period
- [ ] Visual distinction between pending and expired states  
- [ ] Proper loading states during async operations
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly

### Compliance
- [ ] User data completely removed (GDPR/CCPA compliant)
- [ ] Grace period implemented as specified
- [ ] Audit trail maintained (deletion logs)
- [ ] No recovery possible after deletion

## üêõ Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Function does not exist"
**Cause**: SQL functions not deployed to Supabase
**Fix**: Run the complete SQL script in Supabase SQL Editor

### Issue: "Unauthorized" when calling edge function  
**Cause**: Missing or invalid access token
**Fix**: Check authentication and token validity

### Issue: "Grace period has not expired"
**Cause**: Deletion scheduled for future date
**Fix**: Either wait for grace period or manually update scheduled date for testing

### Issue: Partial data deletion
**Cause**: Referential integrity issues or missing tables
**Fix**: Check deletion order and verify all tables included

### Issue: Edge function timeout
**Cause**: Large amounts of data taking too long to delete
**Fix**: Consider batching deletions or increasing timeout limits
