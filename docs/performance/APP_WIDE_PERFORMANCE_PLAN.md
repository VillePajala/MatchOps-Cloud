# App‑Wide Performance Plan – Faster Loads and Snappier UX

## Why

Users judge speed by how quickly the UI reacts, not only by network timings. The goal is to combine real speed improvements (less data, indexed reads, background work) with perceived speed improvements (instant UI, snapshots, skeletons) so the app consistently feels sub‑200ms for common actions.

This document captures the plan we validated for the Load Game flow and generalizes it across the app.

## Current Status ✅

**COMPLETED OPTIMIZATIONS (2025-08-12):**
- ✅ Load Game Performance Optimization (Phases 1.5-4) - **10-25x improvement**
- ✅ N+1 Query Elimination - Events loaded on-demand
- ✅ React Query Refetch Control - Paused during modal usage  
- ✅ RequestIdleCallback Optimization - Background operations deferred
- ✅ New Game Creation Fix - Proper state synchronization
- ✅ Progressive Rendering with Skeleton Components
- ✅ Operation Queue with Priority System (CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW)
- ✅ Immer-based Efficient State Updates
- ✅ Auto-timeout Loading Registry

## Objectives

- Minimize time to first meaningful paint and interaction after sign‑in
- Make heavy views “appear” instantly with useful placeholders
- Eliminate avoidable network and storage latency (N+1, overfetching, cold starts)
- Keep the UI responsive even while background work continues

## Tactics (Playbook)

### 1) Pre‑warm Critical Data After Sign‑In
- Trigger essential queries in the background immediately after auth success (roster, saved games list, seasons/tournaments).
- Keep the cache warm so modals/pages render from memory on first open.

Applies to: Load Game list, Roster screens, Season/Tournament pickers, Admin dashboard.

### 2) Instant UI With Snapshots
- Open views immediately with a cached snapshot (persisted to IndexedDB/localStorage/service worker).
- Render lightweight metadata first (ids, names, dates, small counts). Show skeletons instead of spinners.
- Display “Last updated: Xs ago” and reconcile in the background.

Applies to: Load Game modal, Roster list, Seasons/Tournaments lists, Test/Monitoring pages.

### 3) Fetch Only What’s Needed (Overfetching Kill‑Switch)
- For list views, fetch minimal columns required for rendering the list; defer heavy JSONB fields and denormalized blobs.
- Use strict pagination and virtualized lists for large collections.

Applies to: `games`, `players`, `assessments`, stats dashboards.

### 4) Background Reconciliation
- After showing the snapshot, kick off a background refresh; merge updates without blocking.
- Debounce the first refetch post sign‑in to avoid racing.

Applies to: All react‑query driven data surfaces.

### 5) Abortable, Optimistic Actions
- Cancel in‑flight work when the user changes their mind (AbortController).
- Close modals optimistically and proceed with background hydration; show “finalizing…” when needed.

Applies to: Load Game, Save/Export, Player edits, Settings updates.

### 6) On‑Demand Deep Data
- Keep events, assessments, replay data, and large media on‑demand after the user picks a specific entity.
- The list should never load all children upfront (avoid N+1 at list time).

Applies to: Game events, player assessments, match stats.

### 7) Query Refetch Hygiene
- Pause refetch `onWindowFocus` and intervals while a modal is open; resume on close.
- Use longer stale times for slow‑changing reference data (seasons/tournaments).

Applies to: All modals and heavy lists.

### 8) Server‑Side Speedups
- Ensure proper indexes for hot paths, e.g. `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS games_user_created_idx ON games(user_id, created_at DESC);`
- Prefer views or lightweight summaries for list endpoints over full JSONB unpacking.

Applies to: `games`, `players`, `player_assessments`, `game_events` tables.

### 9) Network Hygiene & Session Warmup
- Reuse connections (keep‑alive) by making a tiny ping after sign‑in so DNS/TLS/JIT are warm.
- Avoid kicking off multiple parallel refetches during the first seconds post sign‑in.

### 10) Operational Guardrails
- Add short timeouts and graceful fallback to cached snapshots if live refresh is slow.
- Track and auto‑clear stuck loading states with a registry + timeout.

### 11) PWA Assist
- Service worker caches the last list/snapshot for instant rendering when returning.
- Reconcile online when available.

### 12) Progressive Rendering & Single Dispatch
- Use a single reducer dispatch (or startTransition) to apply bulk state; avoid cascades of setState.
- Stream heavy slices (field positions, drawings) after first paint.

## Validation & Metrics

### 📊 CURRENT PERFORMANCE RESULTS
**Load Game Modal (Baseline → Optimized):**
- Modal open time: `~3-5 seconds → ~200-300ms` (**10-25x improvement**)
- N+1 queries eliminated: `1 + N events → 1 query` (on-demand)
- Synchronization bottlenecks: `5-10 seconds → 200ms` (**25x improvement**)
- Stuck loading states: `common → eliminated` (auto-timeout registry)

### 🎯 PERFORMANCE BUDGETS
- **Modal open time**: < 200ms (✅ achieved for Load Game)
- **Second load latency**: < 200ms  
- **Cache hit rate**: > 90% for list views
- **Time to interactive**: < 500ms after sign-in

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Reference

### Key Files & Patterns

**N+1 Query Elimination:**
```typescript
// src/lib/storage/supabaseProvider.ts:494-513
async loadGameEvents(gameId: string): Promise<unknown[]> {
  const { data: events, error } = await supabase
    .from('game_events')
    .select('*')
    .eq('game_id', gameId);
  return events || [];
}

// src/utils/savedGames.ts:loadGameEvents utility
export const loadGameEvents = async (gameId: string): Promise<unknown[]> => {
  if (storageManager.loadGameEvents) {
    return await storageManager.loadGameEvents(gameId);
  }
  // Fallback to full game fetch
  const game = await getGame(gameId);
  return game?.gameEvents || [];
};
```

**Progressive Rendering:**
```typescript
// src/utils/loadingRegistry.ts
export class LoadingRegistry {
  private operations = new Map<string, NodeJS.Timeout>();
  
  startOperation(id: string, timeoutMs = 5000) {
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      this.completeOperation(id, false);
    }, timeoutMs);
    this.operations.set(id, timeout);
  }
}

// src/components/Skeleton.tsx  
export const GameLoadingSkeleton: React.FC = () => (
  <div className="animate-pulse space-y-4">
    <div className="h-4 bg-gray-300 rounded w-3/4"></div>
    <div className="h-4 bg-gray-300 rounded w-1/2"></div>
  </div>
);
```

**Operation Priority Queue:**
```typescript  
// src/utils/operationQueue.ts
export enum OperationPriority {
  CRITICAL = 1,    // Game loading - highest priority  
  HIGH = 2,        // User-initiated actions
  MEDIUM = 3,      // Background data refresh
  LOW = 4          // Non-critical background tasks
}

export class OperationQueue {
  enqueue(operation: Operation) {
    if (operation.priority === OperationPriority.CRITICAL) {
      this.clearLowerPriorityOperations(operation.priority);
    }
    // Queue and process...
  }
}
```

**Modal Refetch Control:**
```typescript
// src/hooks/useGameDataQueries.ts:28,99-107
export function useGameDataQueries(options?: { pauseRefetch?: boolean }) {
  const savedGames = useQuery({
    queryKey: queryKeys.savedGames,
    queryFn: getSavedGames,
    refetchOnWindowFocus: !options?.pauseRefetch, // Pause during modal usage
    refetchInterval: options?.pauseRefetch ? false : 2 * 60 * 1000,
  });
}

// src/components/HomePage.tsx:434,449
const { ... } = useGameDataQueries({ 
  pauseRefetch: loadGameModal.isOpen // Pause refetch when modal open
});
```

**RequestIdleCallback Optimization:**
```typescript
// src/hooks/useAutoBackup.ts:39-49
const scheduleBackup = () => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.requestIdleCallback && delay === 0) {
    // Use requestIdleCallback for immediate execution (better performance)
    window.requestIdleCallback(() => {
      if (!cancelled) run();
    });
  } else {
    // Use setTimeout for delayed execution or fallback
    timeout = setTimeout(run, delay);
  }
};
```

**Efficient State Updates with Immer:**
```typescript
// src/components/HomePage.tsx:1046-1074
const newGameSessionState = produce(initialGameSessionData, draft => {
  if (gameData) {
    // Only update fields that have changed from the loaded game data
    if (gameData.teamName !== undefined) draft.teamName = gameData.teamName;
    if (gameData.gameEvents !== undefined) draft.gameEvents = gameData.gameEvents;
    // ... other targeted updates
  }
});
```

### Performance Patterns to Reuse

1. **On-demand Loading**: Load details only when needed, not in list views
2. **Progressive Rendering**: Show skeleton → cached data → live data  
3. **Priority Queuing**: Critical operations cancel lower priority ones
4. **Modal Awareness**: Pause background refetch during user interactions
5. **Idle Scheduling**: Use `requestIdleCallback` for background work
6. **Targeted Updates**: Use Immer for surgical state changes, avoid full reconstruction
