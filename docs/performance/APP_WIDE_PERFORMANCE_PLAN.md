# App‑Wide Performance Plan – Faster Loads and Snappier UX

## Why

Users judge speed by how quickly the UI reacts, not only by network timings. The goal is to combine real speed improvements (less data, indexed reads, background work) with perceived speed improvements (instant UI, snapshots, skeletons) so the app consistently feels sub‑200ms for common actions.

This document captures the plan we validated for the Load Game flow and generalizes it across the app.

## Current Status ✅

**COMPLETED OPTIMIZATIONS (2025-08-12):**
- ✅ **Load Game N+1 Query Elimination** - Per-game event loops removed from list view
- ✅ **Abortable, Optimistic Load** - AbortController + immediate modal close + currentGameId set  
- ✅ **New Game Creation Fix** - Proper state synchronization (`setCurrentGameId`)
- ✅ **RequestIdleCallback for Auto-backup** - Background operations deferred when possible
- ✅ **Per-item Loading States** - `gameLoadingStates` maintained in HomePage

**INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABLE (Not Yet Wired):**
- 🏗️ **Skeleton Components** - `src/components/Skeleton.tsx` exists, LoadGameModal still uses spinner
- 🏗️ **Operation Queue** - `src/utils/operationQueue.ts` exists, not used in load/save paths  
- 🏗️ **Loading Registry** - `src/utils/loadingRegistry.ts` exists, not wired to load flow
- 🏗️ **Modal Refetch Control** - Hook supports `pauseRefetch`, not passed at call site

**PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED:**
- ⚠️ **Progressive Rendering** - Infrastructure exists, not fully wired to LoadGameModal
- ⚠️ **Deferred Persistence** - Uses `setTimeout(..., 0)` not `requestIdleCallback` for load flow

## Objectives

- Minimize time to first meaningful paint and interaction after sign‑in
- Make heavy views “appear” instantly with useful placeholders
- Eliminate avoidable network and storage latency (N+1, overfetching, cold starts)
- Keep the UI responsive even while background work continues

## Tactics (Playbook)

### 1) Pre‑warm Critical Data After Sign‑In
- Trigger essential queries in the background immediately after auth success (roster, saved games list, seasons/tournaments).
- Keep the cache warm so modals/pages render from memory on first open.

Applies to: Load Game list, Roster screens, Season/Tournament pickers, Admin dashboard.

### 2) Instant UI With Snapshots
- Open views immediately with a cached snapshot (persisted to IndexedDB/localStorage/service worker).
- Render lightweight metadata first (ids, names, dates, small counts). Show skeletons instead of spinners.
- Display “Last updated: Xs ago” and reconcile in the background.

Applies to: Load Game modal, Roster list, Seasons/Tournaments lists, Test/Monitoring pages.

### 3) Fetch Only What’s Needed (Overfetching Kill‑Switch)
- For list views, fetch minimal columns required for rendering the list; defer heavy JSONB fields and denormalized blobs.
- Use strict pagination and virtualized lists for large collections.

Applies to: `games`, `players`, `assessments`, stats dashboards.

### 4) Background Reconciliation
- After showing the snapshot, kick off a background refresh; merge updates without blocking.
- Debounce the first refetch post sign‑in to avoid racing.

Applies to: All react‑query driven data surfaces.

### 5) Abortable, Optimistic Actions
- Cancel in‑flight work when the user changes their mind (AbortController).
- Close modals optimistically and proceed with background hydration; show “finalizing…” when needed.

Applies to: Load Game, Save/Export, Player edits, Settings updates.

### 6) On‑Demand Deep Data
- Keep events, assessments, replay data, and large media on‑demand after the user picks a specific entity.
- The list should never load all children upfront (avoid N+1 at list time).

Applies to: Game events, player assessments, match stats.

### 7) Query Refetch Hygiene
- Pause refetch `onWindowFocus` and intervals while a modal is open; resume on close.
- Use longer stale times for slow‑changing reference data (seasons/tournaments).

Applies to: All modals and heavy lists.

### 8) Server‑Side Speedups
- Ensure proper indexes for hot paths, e.g. `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS games_user_created_idx ON games(user_id, created_at DESC);`
- Prefer views or lightweight summaries for list endpoints over full JSONB unpacking.

Applies to: `games`, `players`, `player_assessments`, `game_events` tables.

### 9) Network Hygiene & Session Warmup
- Reuse connections (keep‑alive) by making a tiny ping after sign‑in so DNS/TLS/JIT are warm.
- Avoid kicking off multiple parallel refetches during the first seconds post sign‑in.

### 10) Operational Guardrails
- Add short timeouts and graceful fallback to cached snapshots if live refresh is slow.
- Track and auto‑clear stuck loading states with a registry + timeout.

### 11) PWA Assist
- Service worker caches the last list/snapshot for instant rendering when returning.
- Reconcile online when available.

### 12) Progressive Rendering & Single Dispatch
- Use a single reducer dispatch (or startTransition) to apply bulk state; avoid cascades of setState.
- Stream heavy slices (field positions, drawings) after first paint.

## Specifics for the Load Game Flow 

### ✅ ACTUALLY COMPLETED

**N+1 Query Elimination (Phase 1.5)**
- ✅ Removed per-game event loops from `supabaseProvider.ts`
- ✅ Events left empty in game list for on-demand loading
- **Result**: Eliminated N+1 queries in list view

**Abortable, Optimistic Actions**  
- ✅ `AbortController` with cleanup in `HomePage.tsx`
- ✅ Modal closes immediately, `currentGameId` set before background work
- ✅ Per-item loading states (`gameLoadingStates`) maintained
- **Result**: Responsive UI during load operations

**Background Operation Optimization**
- ✅ `useAutoBackup.ts` uses `requestIdleCallback` for background backup
- ✅ New game creation fix - proper `setCurrentGameId(tempGameId)` call
- **Result**: Background work doesn't block user interactions

### 🏗️ INFRASTRUCTURE EXISTS (NOT WIRED)

**Phase 2: Progressive Rendering**
- 🏗️ `LoadingRegistry` class exists in `src/utils/loadingRegistry.ts`
- 🏗️ `GameLoadingSkeleton` component exists in `src/components/Skeleton.tsx`  
- ❌ LoadGameModal still uses spinner, skeleton not wired
- ❌ Loading registry not used in load flow

**Phase 3: Operation Priority Queue**
- 🏗️ `OperationQueue` exists in `src/utils/operationQueue.ts` 
- ❌ Not used by load/auto-save paths
- ❌ Priority system not integrated

**Phase 4: Efficient State Updates**
- ❌ No Immer `produce()` usage found in HomePage.tsx
- ✅ Uses `startTransition` for batching (acceptable alternative)
- ❌ Still uses large payload dispatch, not surgical updates

### ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**Modal-aware Query Refetch**
- ✅ Hook supports `{ pauseRefetch }` option in `useGameDataQueries.ts`
- ❌ Not passed at call site: needs `useGameDataQueries({ pauseRefetch: loadGameModal.isOpen })`

**On-demand Event Loading**  
- ✅ Events removed from list queries
- ❌ No `loadGameEvents(gameId)` method found for on-demand fetch
- ❌ If events needed after selection, must be added

## App‑Wide Adoption Map

- Roster screens: pre‑warm roster; render cached snapshot; on‑demand player details
- Seasons/Tournaments: minimal list fields, virtualized list, background reconcile
- Player assessments & stats: load aggregates first; fetch per‑game details on demand
- Settings: optimistic UI changes; background persistence with idle scheduling
- Admin monitoring: cached last metrics; background refresh; skeleton charts

## Validation & Metrics

### 📊 CURRENT PERFORMANCE RESULTS
**Load Game Modal (Actual Improvements):**
- N+1 queries eliminated: Per-game event loops removed from list view
- Optimistic UI: Modal closes immediately, `currentGameId` set before background work
- Abortable operations: `AbortController` prevents stuck states from cancelled loads
- Per-item loading states: Individual game loading tracked in UI

**Note**: Exact timing improvements need measurement. Claims of "10-25x improvement" require validation.

### 🎯 PERFORMANCE BUDGETS
- **Modal open time**: < 200ms (🎯 target, needs measurement)
- **Second load latency**: < 200ms (🎯 target, needs measurement)
- **Cache hit rate**: > 90% for list views (🎯 target, not yet implemented)
- **Time to interactive**: < 500ms after sign-in (🎯 target, needs measurement)
- **Background operation delay**: Use `requestIdleCallback` when available (✅ auto-backup only)

### 📈 INSTRUMENTATION
- Use `performance.mark()` and surface timings on monitoring page
- Track React Query cache hit rates and stale times
- Monitor operation queue priorities and completion times
- Measure Immer vs full state reconstruction performance

## Risks & Mitigations

- Stale snapshot confusion → show “Last updated …” and reconcile quickly
- Over‑optimistic UI → provide clear error recovery and revert paths
- Excessive caching → set reasonable stale times and explicit refresh controls

## Rollout Strategy

### ⚠️ PHASE 1: Load Game Flow (PARTIALLY COMPLETED - 2025-08-12)

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Reference

### Key Files & Patterns

**N+1 Query Elimination (ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED):**
```typescript  
// src/lib/storage/supabaseProvider.ts
// Per-game event loops REMOVED from getSavedGames()
// Events left empty in game list for performance

// ❌ loadGameEvents() method NOT FOUND - would need to be added if 
// events are needed after game selection
```

**Progressive Rendering (INFRASTRUCTURE EXISTS, NOT WIRED):**
```typescript
// src/utils/loadingRegistry.ts - EXISTS, not used in load flow
export class LoadingRegistry {
  // ... class exists but not integrated
}

// src/components/Skeleton.tsx - EXISTS, not used in LoadGameModal  
export const GameLoadingSkeleton: React.FC = () => (
  <div className="animate-pulse space-y-4">
    <div className="h-4 bg-gray-300 rounded w-3/4"></div>
    <div className="h-4 bg-gray-300 rounded w-1/2"></div>
  </div>
);

// ❌ LoadGameModal still uses spinner, not skeleton
```

**Operation Priority Queue (EXISTS, NOT USED):**
```typescript  
// src/utils/operationQueue.ts - EXISTS, not used by load/save paths
export enum OperationPriority {
  CRITICAL = 1,    // Game loading - highest priority  
  HIGH = 2,        // User-initiated actions
  MEDIUM = 3,      // Background data refresh
  LOW = 4          // Non-critical background tasks
}

export class OperationQueue {
  // ... class exists but not integrated with actual load/save operations
}

// ❌ Load flow and auto-save don't use priority queue
```

**Modal Refetch Control (HOOK SUPPORTS, NOT USED):**
```typescript
// src/hooks/useGameDataQueries.ts - Hook supports pauseRefetch option ✅
export function useGameDataQueries(options?: { pauseRefetch?: boolean }) {
  const savedGames = useQuery({
    queryKey: queryKeys.savedGames,
    queryFn: getSavedGames,
    refetchOnWindowFocus: !options?.pauseRefetch, // Pause during modal usage
    refetchInterval: options?.pauseRefetch ? false : 2 * 60 * 1000,
  });
}

// ❌ src/components/HomePage.tsx - NOT passing pauseRefetch option
// Current: useGameDataQueries() 
// Needed: useGameDataQueries({ pauseRefetch: loadGameModal.isOpen })
```

**RequestIdleCallback Optimization:**
```typescript
// src/hooks/useAutoBackup.ts:39-49
const scheduleBackup = () => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.requestIdleCallback && delay === 0) {
    // Use requestIdleCallback for immediate execution (better performance)
    window.requestIdleCallback(() => {
      if (!cancelled) run();
    });
  } else {
    // Use setTimeout for delayed execution or fallback
    timeout = setTimeout(run, delay);
  }
};
```

**State Updates (NO IMMER FOUND):**
```typescript
// ❌ No Immer produce() usage found in HomePage.tsx
// ✅ Uses startTransition for batching (acceptable alternative)
// ❌ Still uses large payload dispatch, not surgical updates

// Current approach uses startTransition and dispatch:
startTransition(() => {
  dispatch({
    type: 'LOAD_PERSISTED_GAME_DATA',
    payload: { gameData, isInitialDefaultLoad }
  });
});
```

### Performance Patterns (ACTUAL STATUS)

1. **✅ N+1 Elimination**: Per-game event loops removed from list queries
2. **✅ Optimistic UI**: Modal closes immediately, background work continues  
3. **✅ Abortable Operations**: `AbortController` with cleanup prevents stuck states
4. **✅ Per-item Loading**: Individual game loading states tracked in UI
5. **✅ Idle Scheduling**: `requestIdleCallback` used for auto-backup operations
6. **🏗️ Infrastructure Available**: LoadingRegistry, OperationQueue, Skeleton components exist but not wired
