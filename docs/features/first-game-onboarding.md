# First Game Onboarding

## Overview
Comprehensive three-layer guided onboarding system that helps new users create their first real game with confidence and understanding.

## Current App vs New Behavior

### Current App

- Users must discover features through trial and error

### With First Game Onboarding
- **Three-layer guidance system** provides progressive support
- **Contextual help** appears automatically when needed
- **One-time experience** that doesn't repeat after completion

## User Experience

### Layer 1: Center Overlay
**Appearance**: Welcome message displayed over the soccer field workspace
**Content**:

- Clear call-to-action encouraging them to start
- Professional styling that doesn't obstruct field view

**Triggers**: 
- Appears when user creates their first real game (not demo/tutorial)
- Only shows once per user
- Dismisses automatically when user begins interacting

### Layer 2: Warning Banner
**Appearance**: Persistent top banner during temporary workspace usage
**Content**:
- Explains they're in a temporary game workspace

- "Play Your First Game" (when basic setup complete)

## UI Elements

### Overlay Design

## Completion Tracking

### One-Time Experience
