# Smart Roster Detection

## Overview
Intelligent system that prevents users from encountering empty roster dead-ends by detecting roster states and providing proactive guidance.

## Current App vs New Behavior

### Current App
- Users can attempt to create games even with no players
- Empty roster states can create confusing UI experiences
- No automatic guidance when roster is empty

### With Smart Roster Detection
- App automatically detects when roster is empty
- Proactive alerts prevent dead-end flows
- Users are guided to roster setup when needed
- Different interface experiences for first-time vs experienced users

## User Experience

### Automatic State Detection
- App checks roster status on startup
- Detects empty rosters, saved games, seasons, tournaments
- Provides boolean flags: `hasPlayers`, `hasSavedGames`, `isFirstTimeUser`

### Proactive User Guidance
- **Empty Roster Alert**: "You need to add players before creating a game. Would you like to add some now?"
- **Smart Confirmations**: Context-aware dialogs that guide users to appropriate actions
- **Preventive Blocks**: Stops invalid operations before they create confusing states

### Adaptive Interface
- **First-time users**: See simplified interfaces with guided paths
- **Experienced users**: See full interfaces with intelligent disabled/enabled states
- **StartScreen adaptation**: Different button arrangements based on available data

### Guard Conditions
- Game creation blocked if no players exist
- Load game options hidden if no saved games
- Team management accessible only when players exist
- Contextual messaging explains why certain options are unavailable

## UI Elements

### Detection States
- Visual indicators showing roster completeness
- Button states that reflect data availability
- Conditional rendering of interface elements

### Alert System
- Native browser confirmations for reliability
- Consistent messaging across different contexts
- Multi-language support (English/Finnish)
- Progressive disclosure of complexity

## Key Behaviors
- **Prevents frustration**: Users can't get stuck in empty workflows
- **Guides discovery**: New users are directed to productive first steps
- **Maintains context**: Experienced users see full functionality when appropriate
- **Consistent experience**: Same detection logic applies across all app entry points
