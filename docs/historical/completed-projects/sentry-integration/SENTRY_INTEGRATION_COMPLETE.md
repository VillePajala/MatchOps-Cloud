- Edge runtime configuration in `sentry.edge.config.ts`
- DSN hardcoded as fallback for immediate functionality

### 3. Features Enabled
- ✅ Automatic error capture
- ✅ Performance monitoring (10% sample rate in production)
- ✅ Session replay on errors
- ✅ Breadcrumb tracking
- ✅ User context support
- ✅ Custom error filtering for offline scenarios
- ✅ Source maps configuration

### 4. Web Vitals Integration
- Tracks all Core Web Vitals
- Sends metrics to Sentry
- Performance thresholds configured

### 5. Test & Monitoring Pages
- `/test-sentry` - Test page to verify Sentry is working
- `/admin/monitoring` - Dashboard for monitoring metrics
- `/api/health` - Health check endpoint

## How to Verify

1. **Visit the test page**: Navigate to `/test-sentry`
2. **Send a test message**: Click "Send Test Message"
3. **Check Sentry dashboard**: Go to your Sentry project to see the event

## Environment Variables (Optional)

While the DSN is hardcoded for immediate functionality, you can override it with environment variables:

```env
# .env.local or production environment
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://213e0f22c20b4945be9ffe7e42378a7a@o4508689287593984.ingest.us.sentry.io/4508689295327232
SENTRY_ORG=your-org-name
SENTRY_PROJECT=your-project-name
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token  # For source map uploads
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test in development**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Visit http://localhost:3000/test-sentry
   ```

2. **Configure alerts in Sentry**:
   - Go to your Sentry project
   - Navigate to Alerts → Create Alert Rule
   - Set up notifications for error spikes

3. **Monitor production**:
   - Deploy to production
   - Monitor `/admin/monitoring` dashboard
   - Check Sentry for real user errors

## Build Warnings (Non-Critical)

The build shows some warnings about instrumentation files - these are recommendations for newer Next.js patterns but don't affect functionality. The current setup works correctly.
