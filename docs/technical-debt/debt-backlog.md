| Age Range | Count | Items |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| < 1 week | 21 | All current items |
| 1-2 weeks | 0 | - |
| 2-4 weeks | 0 | - |
| 1-3 months | 0 | - |
| > 3 months | 0 | - |

## Dependencies

### Blocking Other Work
- CR-003 (State Synchronization) blocks multiple state-related features
- CR-001 (JSON parsing) blocks safe import/export features

### External Dependencies
- Supabase client library updates may affect CR-006
- React 19 compatibility may affect CR-011

## Notes

### Patterns Identified
1. **Memory Management**: Multiple components not cleaning up resources
2. **Race Conditions**: Common pattern in async state updates
3. **Error Handling**: Systematic lack of error boundaries
4. **Type Safety**: Migration code has weak typing

### Recommended Approach
1. Create utility functions for common fixes (safe JSON parse, timer management)
2. Implement systematic error boundary strategy
3. Add integration tests for race condition scenarios
4. Consider state machine for complex async flows

## Next Actions

1. Create GitHub issues for all CR items
2. Assign P0 items to current sprint
3. Schedule technical debt review meeting
4. Set up monitoring for memory leaks
5. Create safe JSON parsing utility
