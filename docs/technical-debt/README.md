# Technical Debt Management

This directory contains documentation for tracking and managing technical debt in the Soccer Pre-Game App.

## Overview

Technical debt represents the implied cost of future rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. This documentation helps us track, prioritize, and systematically address technical debt.

## Document Structure

### Active Documents

- **[Code Review Findings - January 2025](./code-review-findings-2025-01.md)** - Latest comprehensive code review with 21 identified issues
- **[Debt Backlog](./debt-backlog.md)** - Ongoing tracking of all technical debt items
- **[Resolution History](./resolution-history.md)** - Completed debt items and lessons learned

## Priority Classification

We classify technical debt by priority:

- **P0 (Critical)**: Production blockers, data loss risks, security vulnerabilities
- **P1 (High)**: Significant bugs, performance issues, maintainability blockers
- **P2 (Medium)**: Quality of life improvements, minor bugs, refactoring needs
- **P3 (Low)**: Nice-to-have improvements, cosmetic issues

## Debt Categories

Technical debt is categorized by type:

1. **State Management**: Store implementations, state synchronization, migrations
2. **Data Persistence**: Storage, backup, synchronization issues
3. **Memory Management**: Leaks, cleanup, resource management
4. **Performance**: Rendering, serialization, blocking operations
5. **Security**: Authentication, data exposure, validation
6. **Type Safety**: TypeScript issues, unsafe casting, missing guards
7. **Testing**: Coverage gaps, flaky tests, missing tests
8. **Architecture**: Component structure, coupling, patterns

## Current Status (January 2025)

### High-Level Metrics
- **Total Debt Items**: 21
- **Critical Issues**: 3
- **High Priority**: 7
- **Medium Priority**: 6
- **Low Priority**: 5
- **Estimated Total Effort**: 48 story points

### Top Priority Items
1. Unprotected JSON.parse() operations causing crashes
2. Memory leaks from uncleared timers
3. Race conditions in state synchronization

## Process

### Discovery
- Regular code reviews (monthly)
- Performance profiling (quarterly)
- Security audits (bi-annually)
- User-reported issues (ongoing)

### Tracking
1. Document findings in dated review files
2. Create GitHub issues with `technical-debt` label
3. Update debt backlog
4. Review in sprint planning

### Resolution
1. Prioritize based on impact and effort
2. Allocate 20% of sprint capacity to debt reduction
3. Document resolution in history
4. Update related documentation

## Contributing

When adding new technical debt documentation:

1. Use the naming convention: `{type}-{date}.md` (e.g., `code-review-2025-01.md`)
2. Follow the template structure from existing documents
3. Link to specific code locations with file:line references
4. Provide reproduction steps for bugs
5. Estimate effort in story points
6. Assign priority based on impact

## Success Metrics

We measure technical debt management success by:

- **Debt Velocity**: Items resolved per sprint
- **Debt Age**: Average age of open items
- **Regression Rate**: Reopened issues percentage
- **Code Quality Score**: Automated quality metrics
- **Performance Metrics**: Load time, memory usage
- **Stability**: Crash rate, error rate
