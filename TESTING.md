# Testing Strategy for Soccer App

This document outlines the testing strategy, frameworks, and conventions used in this project.

## Overview

We employ a three-layered testing approach:

1. **Unit Tests (Jest):** To verify individual functions and logic in isolation, focusing on core utilities and business logic.
2. **Integration Tests (Jest):** To test how components and services work together, often involving component rendering and state interaction, while still mocking external dependencies like APIs.
3. **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Playwright):** To test complete user flows and feature integration within a real browser environment.

## Frameworks

* **Unit & Integration Testing:** [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with `ts-jest` and `next/jest` for TypeScript/Next.js support, and `jsdom` for a simulated browser environment. Uses `@testing-library/react` for component testing.
  * Configuration: `jest.config.js`
  * Setup: `src/setupTests.js` (handles global mocks like `localStorage`)
* **E2E Testing:** [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for cross-browser testing of user interactions and complete features.
  * Configuration: `playwright.config.ts`

## Test Types Defined

* **Unit Tests:** Focus on testing individual functions, methods, or classes in isolation with all dependencies mocked (e.g., `src/utils/fullBackup.test.ts`).
* **Integration Tests:** Test how multiple units work together, such as testing React components interacting with hooks or props, verifying rendering based on state, and simulating user events (`src/components/LoadGameModal.test.tsx`). Dependencies like external APIs or complex browser features (like file reading) are often mocked.
* **End-to-End Tests:** Test the application from a user's perspective, interacting with the UI and verifying the expected behavior across the entire system with minimal mocking (e.g., `tests/backup-restore.spec.ts`).

## Running Tests

* **Unit & Integration Tests:**
  ```bash
  npm run test:unit
  ```
* **E2E Tests:**
  ```bash
  npm run test:e2e
  ```
  Or to run a specific file:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test tests/<filename>.spec.ts
  ```
* **View Last E2E Report:**
  ```bash
  npx playwright show-report
  ```
* **Run All Tests (Unit, Integration, and E2E):**
  ```bash
  npm run test:all
  ```
  This will run Jest tests first, followed by Playwright tests if Jest passes.

## Unit & Integration Tests (Jest)

* **Location:** Test files (`*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx`) are typically located alongside the source files they test within the `src/` directory.
* **Purpose:** Verify the correctness of isolated functions and component interactions.
* **Dependencies:** Mock external dependencies (`localStorage`, `window` APIs, etc.) using `src/setupTests.js` or Jest mocks.

## End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

* **Data Management & Refactoring:**
  * âœ… Created `src/utils/seasons.ts` and `src/utils/tournaments.ts` to centralize `localStorage` CRUD operations for seasons and tournaments.
  * âœ… Added corresponding unit tests (`seasons.test.ts`, `tournaments.test.ts`) ensuring these utilities function correctly.
  * âœ… Refactored `NewGameSetupModal.tsx`, `LoadGameModal.tsx`, and `GameSettingsModal.tsx` to utilize the new season/tournament utility functions, improving data flow and separation of concerns.
  * âœ… Consolidated `Season` and `Tournament` TypeScript interface definitions, making `src/app/page.tsx` the primary source and updating utility files to import from there.
