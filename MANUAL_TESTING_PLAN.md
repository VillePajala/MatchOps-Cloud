## Testing Priority Before Migration

### üî¥ **MUST TEST** (Critical for data integrity):
1. **All Import/Export functionality** - Essential for data migration
2. **Hard Reset functionality** - Need to ensure clean slate works
3. **Undo/Redo system** - Core functionality that affects state management
4. **Error handling** - Must handle edge cases gracefully
5. **Initial setup flow** - Critical for new user experience

### üü° **SHOULD TEST** (Important for completeness):
1. Cross-browser compatibility
2. Performance with large datasets
3. All edge cases marked as "NEW"

### üü¢ **NICE TO TEST** (Can be done post-migration):
1. Extended performance testing
2. Accessibility features
3. Keyboard navigation

---

## Recommended Testing Approach

1. **Create Test Data Set:**
   - Create 5-10 games with various states
   - Include games with many events, different settings
   - Export this as your baseline test data

2. **Test Critical Paths:**
   - Complete game flow: Setup ‚Üí Play ‚Üí Save ‚Üí Export
   - Data integrity: Export ‚Üí Clear ‚Üí Import ‚Üí Verify
   - Error recovery: Corrupt data ‚Üí Load ‚Üí Verify graceful handling

3. **Document Issues:**
   - Keep a log of any issues found
   - Rate severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Fix critical issues before migration

4. **Regression Testing:**
   - After fixes, re-test affected areas
   - Ensure no new issues introduced
