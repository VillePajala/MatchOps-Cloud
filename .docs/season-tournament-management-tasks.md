# Season & Tournament Management Task List

This document tracks work needed to finish the advanced management features for seasons and tournaments.
It builds on the plan in [`season-tournament-management-plan.md`](./season-tournament-management-plan.md).

## 1. Modal Form Enhancements
- [ ] Add inputs for default game parameters (location, period count, period duration).
- [ ] Allow entering a date range or explicit game dates for tournaments.
- [ ] Provide an archive toggle and show quick stats (total games and goals).
- [ ] Support notes, default roster selection and optional color/badge settings.

## 2. Game Prefill Logic
- [ ] When creating a game linked to a season or tournament, prefill settings from that entity.
- [ ] Auto-select the default roster if one is set.

## 3. Import/Export Utilities
- [ ] Implement JSON import/export for season and tournament configurations.
- [ ] Offer calendar (`.ics`) export when dates are defined.

## Status
- [ ] Tasks pending
