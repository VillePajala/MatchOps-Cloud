# Deep Code Review Task List

This document captures follow up tasks discovered during a deeper pass over the codebase. The focus is on potential bugs, suboptimal patterns and areas lacking polish.

## 1. React Hook Dependency Audits
- [ ] Examine every `useEffect` and `useCallback` in `src/components/HomePage.tsx` for missing dependencies. ESLint currently warns about several omissions (e.g. lines ~738, 961, 1292, 1371, 1517). Fix dependency arrays or restructure callbacks to prevent stale closures.
- [ ] Enable the `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` rule project wide to prevent future regressions.

## 2. Local Storage Utilities
- [ ] The helpers in `src/utils/localStorage.ts` wrap synchronous APIs in async functions. Evaluate replacing them with direct synchronous calls or a unified wrapper that checks for `window` availability. Remove unnecessary `Promise.resolve`/`Promise.reject` usage.
- [ ] Harden error handling in `appSettings.ts` and `savedGames.ts` when localStorage fails (e.g. private browsing).

## 3. Game Import Validation
- [ ] Implement schema validation inside `importGamesFromJson` before persisting data. Use `zod` or similar to ensure each imported object conforms to `AppState`.
- [ ] Add unit tests covering invalid JSON, missing fields and overwrite behaviour.

## 4. Timer Improvements
- [ ] `useGameTimer` recreates its interval every second because `timeElapsedInSeconds` is in the dependency list. Refactor to keep a stable interval while running, using a ref for the latest state.
- [ ] Consider moving the `formatTime` helper from `TimerOverlay.tsx` to a shared utility module.

## 5. User Feedback & Logging
- [ ] Provide visual confirmation when the quickâ€‘save operation succeeds (the TODO near line 1782 of `HomePage.tsx`). A toast notification is sufficient.
- [ ] Replace verbose `console.log` statements with a lightweight logging utility that can be disabled in production builds.

## 6. Translation Maintenance
- [ ] The custom augmentations in `src/i18n.ts` complicate merging JSON locale files. Investigate generating type definitions for translation keys and consolidating all translations in JSON to avoid runtime mutations.

## 7. Additional Testing
- [ ] Extend unit tests for `useGameSessionReducer` to cover score adjustment and timer reset edge cases.
- [ ] Add smoke tests for the modal context to ensure modals do not interfere with each other when opened sequentially.
