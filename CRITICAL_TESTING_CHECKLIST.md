## üö® MUST COMPLETE BEFORE MIGRATION

### 1. Data Import/Export Testing
- [ ] **Export Single Game**

## ‚ö° Quick Test Data Setup

```javascript
// Paste this in browser console to quickly create test data
// (Only after verifying it's safe for your current state)

const testPlayers = [
  { name: "Test Player 1", jerseyNumber: "1" },
  { name: "Test Player 2", jerseyNumber: "2" },
  { name: "Test Goalie", jerseyNumber: "99", isGoalie: true }
];

const testGames = [
  { 
    teamName: "Test Team A", 
    opponentName: "Test Opponent A",
    homeScore: 2,
    awayScore: 1
  },
  { 
    teamName: "Test Team B", 
    opponentName: "Test Opponent B",
    homeScore: 0,
    awayScore: 3
  }
];

console.log("Test data templates ready. Manually create games with these values.");
