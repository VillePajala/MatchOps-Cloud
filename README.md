# MatchOps Coach

**Plan ‚Ä¢ Track ‚Ä¢ Debrief**

A comprehensive Progressive Web App (PWA) for soccer coaches to manage rosters, track live game events, analyze detailed statistics, and design plays on an interactive tactics board. Built for the sideline, available on any device, with cloud synchronization and offline-first capabilities.

## TL;DR Quick Start

### Cloud mode (Supabase)
1. Clone and install
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VillePajala/soccer-pre-game-app.git
   cd soccer-pre-game-app && npm install
   ```
2. Create `.env.local` (see Environment Variables below) with at least:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...    
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUPABASE=true
   ```
3. Run the app
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Sign up in the app, create a team, and start a new game.

### Local mode (no cloud)
- Skip Supabase env vars, run `npm run dev`. Data is stored in the browser (IndexedDB/localStorage). Export/Import backups from Settings anytime.

## Architecture at a glance
- Next.js App Router + client providers
- Storage layers
  - Supabase (Auth, PostgREST) when enabled
  - IndexedDB cache for offline-first reads
  - localStorage fallback if cloud disabled/unavailable
- PWA service worker
  - App shell caching, data-cache for GETs, no caching for non-GET
  - Update banner + Settings action to refresh to latest
- React Query for server state, Zustand for app/session state

## Operational essentials

### PWA updates
- You‚Äôll see an in-app banner when a new version is available. Click Update to activate the new SW and auto-reload.
- You can also check via Settings ‚Üí Check for updates. The update flow is safe and preserves your data.
  - More: `docs/production/APP_UPDATE_FLOW_FIX_PLAN.md`

### Import/Export (Backups)
- Export a full backup (players, games, seasons, tournaments, settings) from Settings.
- Importing a backup now automatically remaps old player IDs to the new UUIDs.
  - This prevents empty player bars and broken stats after imports.
  - Any unmapped references are safely dropped and listed in the import log.
  - More: `docs/archive/IMPORT_FIX_SUMMARY.md`, `docs/archive/STATS_FIX_SUMMARY.md`

### Reset vs Delete
- Hard Reset App (Settings ‚Üí Danger Zone):
  - Wipes ALL user data for this account (players, games, seasons, tournaments, settings), clears caches, and reloads. Your login remains.
- Delete Account:
  - Removes your Supabase Auth user and all data. Irreversible.

### Multi‚Äëdevice sessions
- You can be signed in on multiple devices. Use:
  - Sign out (this device only)
  - Sign out everywhere (global): revokes sessions on all devices (Settings ‚Üí Account).
  - Session manager handles inactivity timeouts and token refresh.

### Monitoring and error reporting
- Admin monitoring page and Sentry integration are available for diagnostics.
  - More: `docs/production/MONITORING_SETUP.md`, `docs/production/SENTRY_*`

## Support & compatibility
- Desktop: Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox (latest)
- Mobile: iOS Safari (PWA install supported), Android Chrome (TWA-ready)
- Offline: Full offline workflow; background sync when back online.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VillePajala/soccer-pre-game-app.git
    cd soccer-pre-game-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env.local` file:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```
    Then configure your environment variables:
    - **Required for cloud features:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
    - **Feature flags:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUPABASE=true`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_OFFLINE_CACHE=true`
    - **Optional:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_FALLBACK=false`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to start using the app.

   When launched, you can choose to use the app locally (localStorage) or create an account for cloud synchronization. A **Start Screen** appears with options to start a new game, load an existing one, create a season or tournament, or view statistics. Select an action to continue to the main field view.

### Common scripts
```bash
npm run dev           # Start dev server with hot reload
npm run build         # Production build with optimization
npm start             # Start production server
npm run test:unit     # Run unit test suite
npm run test:ci       # Run tests in CI mode
npm run lint          # ESLint code quality checks
npm run type-check    # TypeScript diagnostics
npm run analyze       # Bundle size analysis
```

## Running Tests

Install project dependencies with `npm install` as shown above. Then execute the automated test suite with:

```bash
npm test
# or
npm run test:unit
```

The tests rely on [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file using `.env.example` as a template. The key variables are:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration (Required for cloud features)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=public-anon-key

# Feature Flags
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUPABASE=true           # Enable cloud synchronization
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_OFFLINE_CACHE=true     # Enable IndexedDB offline caching
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_FALLBACK=false        # Control localStorage fallback

# Optional Server-side Keys
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-role-key  # For server-side operations
```

These values configure the multi-layer storage system and enable/disable specific features. The app works locally without Supabase configuration but requires it for cross-device synchronization.

## Important Notes

*   **Storage Architecture:** The app uses a sophisticated multi-layer storage system:
    - **Cloud Mode:** Data synced to Supabase with offline IndexedDB caching for instant loading
    - **Local Mode:** Data stored in browser localStorage with optional backup/restore
    - **Automatic Fallback:** Seamless fallback from cloud to local storage if needed
*   **Authentication:** Optional but recommended for cross-device synchronization and enhanced features
*   **Offline Experience:** Full functionality available offline with automatic sync when connection is restored
*   **PWA Installation:** Install as a native app from your browser for the best experience ("Add to Home Screen" on mobile, install icon in address bar on desktop)

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues (Resolved in Recent Updates):**
- ‚úÖ **Goalie Toggle Problems**: Fixed player not found errors and multiple goalie selections
- ‚úÖ **PlayerBar Visual Updates**: Resolved display issues without breaking functionality  
- ‚úÖ **Season Creation**: Fixed loading states that appeared stuck
- ‚úÖ **New Game Setup**: Prevented duplicate goalie selections in fresh games

**Technical Issues:**
- **Service worker failed to register**: Ensure `public/sw.js` exists in production and CSP contains `worker-src 'self'` and appropriate `connect-src` entries for Supabase
- **Supabase 401 after sign-in**: Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL/ANON_KEY`, and that `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUPABASE=true` in `.env.local`
- **Imported games show no players**: Re-import with the new importer (auto ID remap). Check the on-page import log for "remapped" and "dropped" counts
- **Update banner doesn't show**: Open Settings ‚Üí Check for updates; verify network requests aren't blocked by CSP
