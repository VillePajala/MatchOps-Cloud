## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VillePajala/soccer-pre-game-app.git
    cd soccer-pre-game-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env.local` file:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```
    Then configure your environment variables:
    - **Required for cloud features:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
    - **Feature flags:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUPABASE=true`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_OFFLINE_CACHE=true`
    - **Optional:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_FALLBACK=false`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to start using the app.

   When launched, you can choose to use the app locally (localStorage) or create an account for cloud synchronization. A **Start Screen** appears with options to start a new game, load an existing one, create a season or tournament, or view statistics. Select an action to continue to the main field view.

## Running Tests

Install project dependencies with `npm install` as shown above. Then execute the automated test suite with:

```bash
npm test
# or
npm run test:unit
```

The tests rely on [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file using `.env.example` as a template. The key variables are:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration (Required for cloud features)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=public-anon-key

# Feature Flags
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUPABASE=true           # Enable cloud synchronization
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_OFFLINE_CACHE=true     # Enable IndexedDB offline caching
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_FALLBACK=false        # Control localStorage fallback

# Optional Server-side Keys
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-role-key  # For server-side operations
```

These values configure the multi-layer storage system and enable/disable specific features. The app works locally without Supabase configuration but requires it for cross-device synchronization.

## Important Notes

*   **Storage Architecture:** The app uses a sophisticated multi-layer storage system:
    - **Cloud Mode:** Data synced to Supabase with offline IndexedDB caching for instant loading
    - **Local Mode:** Data stored in browser localStorage with optional backup/restore
    - **Automatic Fallback:** Seamless fallback from cloud to local storage if needed
*   **Authentication:** Optional but recommended for cross-device synchronization and enhanced features
*   **Offline Experience:** Full functionality available offline with automatic sync when connection is restored
*   **PWA Installation:** Install as a native app from your browser for the best experience ("Add to Home Screen" on mobile, install icon in address bar on desktop)
